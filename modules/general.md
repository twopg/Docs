# General

### Auto Roles

Roles automatically given to a member upon joining the server. For example, if `@Member` and `@Special Snowflake` was an auto role, then the member would automatically be given both roles.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Avoid giving the auto role role administrator permissions, lest any user has access to dangerous actions.
{% endhint %}

### Ignored Channels

The channels where command execution is ignored. For example, if `#general` was ignored, .`ping` would not work in that `#general`.

### Prefix

The characters preceding a command. For example, .`ping` -&gt; prefix is . as it precedes the command nam
