# Get Started

## 1. Invite the Bot

Invite the bot to your server: [https://2pg.xyz/invite](https://2pg.xyz/invite). This will redirect you to a Discord authorization page where you can add the bot.

 Make sure 2PG has **Administrator** permissions or the necessary permissions required, to ensure that all functions work correctly.
{% endhint %}

### 2. Customize Your Server\(s\)

This can be done at [https://2pg.xyz/dashboard](https://2pg.xyz/dashboard) and clicking on your server, or by [https://2pg.xyz/servers/\[yourServerId](https://2pg.xyz/servers/[yourServerId)\] and replacing `[yourServerId]` with your server ID.
